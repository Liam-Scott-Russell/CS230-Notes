    "# Extra Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Streams\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "* The streams library provides functional tools like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`\n",
    "* Streams don't change the original data structure, they simply return a result\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stream Process\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using streams in java can be divided up into 3 steps:\n",
    "    * Conversion to stream object\n",
    "    * Intermediate operations\n",
    "    * Terminal operations\n",
    "* All intermediate functions return another stream object, so intermediate operations can be chained\n",
    "    * This means that they must also be terminated back into another form later\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Converting to Stream Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "* For arrays, the streams class is used as follows `java.util.Arrays.stream(<arrObject>)`\n",
    "    * You have to type this out in CodeRunner, as for some reason it doesn't like importing it\n",
    "* For array lists, the streams class is built in, and used as `arrList.stream()`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intermediate Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Map\n",
    "\n",
    "* The syntax for `map` is `<streamobj>.map(x -> <function>)`\n",
    "* The map function applies a given function to all elements of the stream\n",
    "* e.g. `stream(numbers).map(num -> num * num)` will square all of the numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Filter\n",
    "\n",
    "* The syntax for `filter` is `<streamObj>.filter(x -> <predicate>)`\n",
    "* The filter function will iterate through the collection and return all elements for which the predicate is true\n",
    "* e.g. `stream(numbers).filter(num -> num % 2 == 0);` returns all of the numbers that are even \n",
    "    * Note that I omit the boilerplate code of `java.util.Arrays.stream` here\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sorted\n",
    "\n",
    "* The syntax for `sorted` is `<streamObj>.sorted(<comparator>)`\n",
    "* the sorted function will sort the stream using the comparator\n",
    "    * The default comparator for `sorted()` is increasing\n",
    "* e.g. `stream(numbers).sorted()` sorts the numbers in increasing order\n",
    "* e.g. `stream(numbers).sorted(java.util.Comparator.reverseOrder())` reverse sorts the numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Comparators\n",
    "\n",
    "* `java.util.Comparator` contains a variety of ways to sort objects:\n",
    "    * `Comparator.nullsFirst()` will sort naturally and place `null` objects first\n",
    "    * `Comparator.nullsLast()` will sort naturally and place `null` objects last\n",
    "    * `Comparator.naturalOrder()` will sort in increasing order\n",
    "    * `Comparator.reverseOrder()` will sort in reverse order\n",
    "    * `Comparator.comparing(<Class>::<Method>)` will compare objects based on the attribute returned by the method reference\n",
    "        * e.g. `Comparator.comparing(Human::getAge())` will sort `Human` objects by their ages\n",
    "    * `Comparator.comparing(<Class>::<Method>, Comparator.reverseOrder())` will compare objects based on the attribute returned by the method reference, in reverse order\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terminal Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Collect\n",
    "\n",
    "* The syntax for the `collect` method is `<streamObj>.collect(<Collector>)`\n",
    "* The collect method will return the stream in the target format\n",
    "* e.g. `numbersList.stream().collect(java.util.Collectors.toList())` returns a list\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Collectors\n",
    "\n",
    "* Some of the available collectors in `java.util.Collectors` are:\n",
    "    * `Collectors.toList()` will return a `List` object\n",
    "    * `Collectors.toSet()` will return a `Set` object\n",
    "    * `Collectors.toCollection(<Collection>::new)` will allow you to terminate in a custom collection\n",
    "        * e.g. `Collectors.toCollection(ArrayList::new)` will turn the stream into an array list\n",
    "    * `Collectors.joining(<joinString>)` will join `String` streams \n",
    "        * e.g. `{\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"}.stream().collect(Collectors.joining(\" \"))` will give `\"a b c\"`\n",
    "* For more collectors, see [here](https://www.baeldung.com/java-8-collectors)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ForEach\n",
    "\n",
    "* The syntax for `forEach` is `<streamObj>.forEach(x -> <expression>)`\n",
    "* The `forEach` method iterates through the collection and applies a method\n",
    "* `forEach` is similar to `map`, except `forEach` should **not** return anything\n",
    "* For example `stream(numbers).map(x -> x * x).forEach(y -> System.out.println(y))` will print all of the numbers squared\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reduce\n",
    "\n",
    "* The syntax for `reduce` is `<streamObj>.reduce((a, b), <BinaryOperator>)`\n",
    "* The reduce method is used to reduce the collection down to a single element\n",
    "* e.g. `stream(numbers).reduce(1, (prod, i) -> prod * i)` will multiply all of the numbers\n",
    "    * Initially `prod` is set to 1, and then all elements are multiplied against the rolling value of `prod`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Helper Functions Worth Knowing\n",
    "\n",
    "* `<streamObj>.distinct()` will return a new stream object of all the **unique** elements of the old object\n",
    "    * This is an intermediate operation\n",
    "* `<streamObj>.sum()` will return the sum of the elements of the stream object\n",
    "    * This is a terminal operation\n",
    "    * This only works when the stream is composed of `Integer` objects\n",
    "* `<streamObj>.count()` will return a `long` representing the number of elements in the stream object\n",
    "    * This is a terminal operation\n",
    "    * This can also be achieved using `<streamObj>.reduce(0, (count, i) -> count + 1)`\n",
    "* `<streamObj>.findFirst(<condition>)` will return an `Option` of the first element that satisfies the condition\n",
    "    * This is a terminal operation\n",
    "    * See **Handling Options** for information about options\n",
    "* `<streamObj>.max(<Comparator>)` will return an `Option` of the type of the stream for the max value\n",
    "    * This is a terminal operation\n",
    "    * The `<Comparator>` parameter is optional, and allows you to specify how the max value is found\n",
    "    * See **Handling Options** for information on how to work with this\n",
    "* `<streamObj>.min(<Comparator>)` will return an `Option` of the type of the stream for the min value\n",
    "    * This is a terminal operation\n",
    "    * The `<Comparator>` parameter is optional, and allows you to specify how the min value is found\n",
    "    * See **Handling Options** for information on how to work with this\n",
    "* `<streamObj>.mapToInt(x -> <expression>) will return an `IntegerStream` of the stream object\n",
    "    * This is an intermediate operation\n",
    "    * e.g. `stream(arr).mapToInt(x -> stream(x).sum())` returns the row sums of a 2D array\n",
    "    \n",
    "##### Handing Options\n",
    "\n",
    "* Some terminal operations on streams may or may not return `null`, depending on if they find a match\n",
    "    * In these situations, the methods return an `Option` of the type of the collection\n",
    "* To retrieve the value, you just use `<optionObj>.get()`, but this may return an error if it is `null`\n",
    "* To safely retrieve the value, use `<optionObj>.orElse(<backup>)`, which will return the value if it exists, or it will return the `backup` value otherwise\n",
    "* To check whether the value is `null`, use `<optionObj>.isPresent()` which will return a `boolean`\n"
