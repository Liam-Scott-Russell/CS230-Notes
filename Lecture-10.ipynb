    "# Lecture 10 - Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "public class <subclass name> extends <superclass name { \n",
    "    public <subclass name>(<parameters>){\n",
    "        super();\n",
    "        <constructor code>\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    <code>\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A new class is created by acquiring an existing class's members and possibly\n",
    "embellishing them with new or modified capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Existing class is called the **super class or base**\n",
    "- The new class is called the **subclass / derived (from parent)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The derived class inherits attributes of the parent class. You build new methods/ variables on top of those inherited from the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A subclass is more specific than it's superclass, and represents a more specialised group of objects. A subclass can in turn be used as a superclass for a child class which inherits it's properties. For example, you declare a `Person` class. This is implicity a subclass of Java's `Object` class. If you then declare a subclass of `Person`, e.g `Employee`, you have a class which is a subclass of a subclass. This process can repeat recursively. We can describe the relationship between super/subclasses as hierachical.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: Java only supports single inheritance, so only **one** class may be used as the superclass for any given class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can save time during development by basing new classes on existing classes which have already been tested/ proven to function correctly.\n",
    "- Increased ability to implement and maintain components within the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Has-a vs Is-a relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Has-a**: Inheritance, an object of a subclass can also be treated as an object of its superclass\n",
    "- **Is-a**: Composition, a class contains references to other objects as members/ variables\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "- A subclass can inherit methods it does not need/ utilise.\n",
    "- The subclass will often need to customise what it inherits from the superclass to meet it's needs.\n",
    "- The subclass can **override** methods in the superclass to meet it's needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT EXAMPLE STUFF\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constructors\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each subclass constructor must call the superclass constructor (implicitly or explicitly)\n",
    "  - If the code does not include an explicit call to the superclass constructor, the default no-argument constructor from the superclass will be used.\n",
    "  - An explicit superclass constructor call can be made by the `super(<variable/s>)` call in the subclass constructor.\n",
    "- A subclass cannot inherit constructors from the base class. Each subclass should define its constructor.\n",
    "  - If there is not constructor defined, a standard default constructor will be added by the compiler. This will apply default initialisation for any data fields as expected.\n",
    "  - If you initialise a subclass instance with `x | x != 0` argument's, but there are no constructors which accept `x`arguments, a `Compile Time Error` will be thrown.\n",
    "\n",
    "  CONSOLIDATE NOTES FOR DIFF # OF CONSTRUCTORS AND BEHAVIOR\n",
    "\n",
    "- Superclass constructors can only be called from a subclass constructor.\n",
    "- Always place the superclass's constructor call before any other code in the subclass constructor. This is because subsequent code could depend on initialisation by the superclass's constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Access modifiers with Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Classes, and their fields and methods have access levels to specify how they can be used by other objects during execution.\n",
    "  - **Private** - accessible only to the class where it is defined. *i.e. Will not be accessible to subclasses.*\n",
    "  - **Protected** - accessible to the class where it is defined *and* subclasses.\n",
    "  - **Public** - accessible to any class of any package.\n",
    "- Subclass methods can refer to public and protected members inherited from the superclass simply by using the member names.\n",
    "- When a subclass method overrides an inherited superclass method, the superclass version of the method can be accessed method name with `super.<method>()`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method Overwriting\n",
    "\n",
    "- To override a superclass method, the subclass must declare a method with the **same signature** as the superclass method.\n",
    "- `@Override` annotation:\n",
    "  - Indicates that a method should override a superclass method with the same signature.\n",
    "  - If it does not, a compilation error occurs\n",
    "  - If you want to use the overridden method later, access it with the syntax: `super.<method>()`\n",
    "CHECK THIS\n",
