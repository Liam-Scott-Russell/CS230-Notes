    "# Lecture 6 - Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Data structures in Java are categorised into two types, Primitive and Reference Types.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable assigned to a Primitive type will contain the explicit value, whereas when assigned to a Reference type, the variable will contain the location in memory where that object is stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arrays - Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consist of data items of the *same type*\n",
    "- An enhanced `for` loop may be used to iterate through Array items for increased efficiency.\n",
    "  - `for (<VariableType> <name>: <array name>) { <code> }`\n",
    "  - **Note:** you cannot modify elements of the array **with this enhanced for loop** whilst iterating through it, only obtain them. A regular for loop, conditioned upon the length of the array would be able to do this.\n",
    "- The **Array** object can be categorised as a **Reference Type**.\n",
    "- If an array is not initialized explicitly, it will be assigned a `null` value.\n",
    "- The `type` of the array is determined by the element type assigned when it is instantiated.\n",
    "- Default values for various types are:\n",
    "  - `int`: `0`\n",
    "  - `String`: `null`\n",
    "  - `boolean`: `false`\n",
    "- The length of an array is **fixed** when it is created, and may only be altered via redeclaration.\n",
    "- The Array object contains a `length` variable, which may be accessed to obtain the length of the array.\n",
    "- Array names follow the same naming conventions as regular variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple accepted ways to declare an array. The following are the most conventional:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Declare array with size: `<type>[] <name> = new <type>[<size>];`\n",
    "- Declare array with data directly: `<type>[] <name> = {5.1, 3.02, 9.65};`\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g `int[] ages = new int[10];` this will be indexed [0,9], with the default `int` values of `0`. I.e. `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access elements of an array by their index. `<array name>[<element index>] = <value>`. Accessing elements via this method is a constant time operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arguments for the method main\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run a program from the command line, all words after the class name will be passed to the main method in the args array.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run the program (usually from the command line), you can pass args into the main method. This will be split into an array of strings that can be accessed through the `args` array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing arrays for equality\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison (`==`) will compare the **references** of each array, not the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Copying arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "The `System.arraycopy` method will copy the source array from a specified start and end position, this will be saved to a new memory location, which must be declared prior.\n",
    "\n",
    "To copy the array you run the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "System.arraycopy(<source array>,<start position in src array>,<destination array>,<insertion position in destination array>,<length of copy>)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: use this method you will need to create the destination array first.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The length of the copy is indexed from zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "To copy entire array, call the `.clone()` method on the array you wish to copy, and assign it to an array while declaring it.\n",
    "\n",
    "`<type>[] <name> = <source>.clone()`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pass-by-value\n",
    "\n",
    "When calling a method, you can pass either a primitive value or the reference to an object. An object itself will not get passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference types will only pass memory locations. When a reference type variable is passed to a method, you can either modify the original object, or chose to make a copy of it within the scope of the method, to preserve the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Passing Arrays to Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Passing Entire Array\n",
    "\n",
    "To pass an array you specify the name of the array, as if it was a variable. The method will receive a copy of the objects reference. You can then manipulate the array within the scope of the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Passing Array Elements to Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "To pass the element of an array simply use standard bracket notation to access the desired element. e.g `<array>[<size>]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method will recieve a copy of the objects value, rather than a reference to the address. This means any changes made to the variable within the method will not affect the original value of the element.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variable-length argument lists\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create methods that receive an unspecified number of arguments. This may be done once at the end of the parameter list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for this is: `<type>... <variable>`. `<variable>` will be an array containing `<variable.length>` many `<type>` elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g `public static double average(double... numbers)`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multidimensional Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "Have more than one index, the number of indexes = number of dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multidimensional arrays of 2 dimensions (referred to as 2D arrays) are often used to represent tables of values with data arranged into rows and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Declaration\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2D Array:\n",
    "  - `<type> [] [] <name> = new <type> [<size1>][<size2>]`\n",
    "  - `<type> [][] <name>= { {1,2,3}, {4,5,6}};`\n",
    "- 3D Array: `<type> [] [] [] <name> = new <type> [<size1>][<size2>][<size3>]`\n",
    "- This can be extrapolated onwards for arrays with more dimensions...\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g. `int[][] x = new int[5][7];` will have five rows and seven columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can form 3d arrays from mutiple 2d arrays.\n",
    "e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh \n",
    "int[] a1 = {10,12,14}; \n",
    "int[] a2 = {20,22,24};\n",
    "int[][] a3 = {a1, a2};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will copy the references of the objects so `a1[2] == a3[0][2]`. To avoid this we can substitute `int[][] a3 = {a1, a2};` for `int[][] a3={a1.clone(), a2.clone()};`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "This is done in the same fashion as for a regular array, simply requiring more brackets to point the program to the correct row/column.\n",
    "\n",
    "`<name>[<row>][<column>]`\n",
    "\n",
    "To **iterate** through a multidimsional array, you will need to nest `for` loops, so you can iterate through every column of every row etc. This means for a 2D array you would need 2 loops, 3D array requires 4 etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g. Print all elements in a 2d array.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "int[][] y = { {1,2,3}, {4,5,6} }; \n",
    "for (int row = 0; row < y.length; row++) { \n",
    "    for (int col = 0; col < y[row].length; col++) {\n",
    "        System.out.print(y[row][col] + \" \"); System.out.println();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Length Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "When accessing the length of an array we use the `.length` property belonging to each array.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `array.length` will give number of rows in array\n",
    "- `array[i].length` will give the number of elements/ columns in the ith row.\n",
    "- This can be extended for arrays with more dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cloning Multidimensional Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Shallow Clone \n",
    "\n",
    "You may use `<array>.clone()` syntax to clone a multidimensional array, however this will only be a shallow clone, i.e. it will reference the same place in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deep Clone\n",
    "\n",
    "A deep copy is copy that contains the complete data of the original object, allowing it to be used independently of the original object.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this you take a shallow clone of the array you are copying, then iterate through each element in the new array, and create a new copy of them. This will generate new places in memory, so will not contain the same references as the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g. Cloning an array of Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "Point[] q = new Point[2]; q[0] = new Point(10, 20); q[1] = new Point(20, 30);\n",
    "Point[] dest = q.clone();\n",
    "\n",
    "for (int i = 0; i < q.length; i++) {\n",
    "    dest[i] = (Point)q[i].clone( );\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "dest[0].x = 100; \n",
    "System.out.println(q[0].toString());\n",
    "\n",
    "// Output: java.awt.Point[x=10,y=20]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ragged Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "Ragged Arrays are formed when a multidimensional array has rows of different lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arrays of Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays of Objects can be declared in the same way as any other array. The type will be that of your object class. It is important to note that these objects are Reference Types, so all the rules discusses above will apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the object has not been created before you access it, a `NullPointerException` will be thrown."
