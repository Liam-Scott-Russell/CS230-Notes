    "### Java Docs & API\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are grouped into packages, allowing access to their methods, constructors etc. i.e `java.util.Scanner`\n",
    "Briefly covered methods available to be imported. Refer [Java Docs.](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/index.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Console Output and Printing to console\n",
    "\n",
    "### Console Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The method `System.out.println()` prints with a newline (`/n`) character at the end of each statement, whilst the `System.out.print()` will continue to print onto the same line.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Java Escape Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer table for more information:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Java Escape Sequences](resources/lecture-2/string-formatting-table.JPG \"Java Escape Sequences\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formatting Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The preferred method of output for formatted strings is **Print format string:** `System.out.printf(format_string[, one or more variables]);`\n",
    "This allows much easier String interpolation in relation to concatenating within  `System.out.println()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The following formats should be used in the `System.out.printf()` function to delineate the variable type you are interpolating:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Conversion Character | Output                |\n",
    "|----------------------|-----------------------|\n",
    "| %c                   | character             |\n",
    "| %d                   | Decimal Integer       |\n",
    "| %f                   | Floating point number |\n",
    "| %s                   | String                |\n",
    "| %n                   | New line              |\n",
    "\n",
    "More complex formats see: [Java String Format Examples](https://dzone.com/articles/java-string-format-examples)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "`%[flags][width][.precision][argsize]typechar`\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Flags\n",
    "\n",
    "Flags can be '+' or '-', and will have varying roles dependent on where they are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "- '-' will left align the println\n",
    "- '+' will show a '+' sign in front of positive numbers when used with %d, %f\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Width\n",
    "\n",
    "Width is the minimum number of characters to be printed. If the value < width, the remaining characters required to make up the minimum width specified will consist of spaces, creating a left padding. If the width specified is exceeded, no truncation will occur (i.e because this is the *minimum* width).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Precision\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of digits to be displayed after the decimal point.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example from Coursebook\n",
    "\n",
    "`%-15.1f`: Display up to 15 left-justified characters, pad fewer than 15 characters on the right with blank spaces (i.e., field width is 15) and display exactly 1 digit after the decimal point (.1)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables and Literals\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variable** - named storage location\n",
    "**Literal** - value written into the code of the program\n",
    "E.g\n",
    "\n",
    "``` sh\n",
    "int value; // declares a variable\n",
    "System.out.println('This is a string') // the string provided is a literal, as it is hardcoded into the program\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Declaration and Initialisation\n",
    "\n",
    "Java is statically typed, meaning that variables must be declared before use. From the point of declaration, they can be assigned a value provided it matches the type of the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Identifiers** are the names declared for classes, variables and methods. These must be named against standard conventions. Camel case is preferred to hyphenating-the-variable-name. [Java Reserved Keywords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Java_keywords) must not be used for naming.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constants** are defined with final prefixed before the type. E.g `final LOVE_FOR_CODERUNNER = 0`. They do not need to be initialised at declaration but cannot be altered programmatically afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Primitive Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 8 Primitive Data Types: **byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numeric Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "| Name   | Size (bytes) | Type    | Range                                                    |\n",
    "|--------|--------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| byte   | 1            | Integer | `[-128,127]`                                             |\n",
    "| short  | 2            | Integer | `[-32768,32767]`                                         |\n",
    "| int    | 4            | Integer | `[-2 147 483 648,2 147 483 647]`                         |\n",
    "| long   | 8            | Integer | `[-9 223 372 036 854 775 808,9 223 372 036 854 775 807]` |\n",
    "| float  | 4            | float   | `[±3.410^(-38),±3.410-38]` with 7 digits of accuracy     |\n",
    "| double | 8            | float   | `[±1.710-308,±1.710308]` with 15 digits of accuracy      |\n",
    "\n",
    "Floating point numbers will often be represented in standard form, with an `E` denoting the `*10^x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **char** data type will hold one character.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **boolean** data type will hold a True/ False value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Type Conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "Java supports two types of castings – *primitive* data type casting and *reference* type casting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implicit Casting\n",
    "\n",
    "A data type of lower size (i.e occupies less memory) is assigned to a data type of larger size.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "double d = 4.9;\n",
    "int i = 10;\n",
    "double d1, d2;\n",
    "d1 = i; // wider assignment\n",
    "d2 = (double) i; // wider casting\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Wider casting is not always required, however it increases readability etc. The assignment of `d1` and `d2` gave the same outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explicit Casting\n",
    "\n",
    "A data type of higher size (i.e occupies less memory) is assigned to a data type of smaller size. This cannot be done implicitly by the JCM, so **requires** casting. This will cause the larger data type to be *narrowed* to fit the size requirements of the smaller data type (as outlined in the table above).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Boolean Casting\n",
    "\n",
    "A boolean value cannot be casted/ assigned to any other data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "- **char <> int**: char -> int will use the characters ASCII value to assign an integer, and vice versa for int -> char.\n",
    "- **char <> double**: same as above, with floating point numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### String to numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Parsing a String to an number requires use of the appropriate parsing method from the Data type's class.\n",
    "e.g: `int num = Integer.parseInt(input)`. Same for float, double etc.\n"
